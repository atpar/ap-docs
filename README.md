**Core features:**

* Issue financial assets
* Progress assets throughout their lifecycle
* Tokenize cash flows of assets

ACTUS Protocol contains an open-source implementation of the [ACTUS](https://www.actusfrf.org/) standard, which the rest of protocol is build on.

All ACTUS assets have a unified term sheet and a clear and well-defined schedule. External data, such as changing interest rates are supported through external market objects which can be connected to oracles. Assets can have credit enhancements such as on-chain collateral or legal guarantees.

ACTUS Assets are registered in an asset registry. They are progressed through their lifecycle according to their schedule. An Asset's schedule, which is the basis for the state machine, is derived from its terms using the solidity implementation of ACTUS, guaranteeing a common understanding about _who owes what to whom and when_.
